# Simple React Mention Component

I needed this kind of component, but couldnt find any good examples, so i created my own :)
Its a simple textarea field that lets you add suggestions (you can mention users by their name), this information is then processed into **markdown** and you can also provide an **email** that will then be reflected in the markdown.
You can have a look at the demo here:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
